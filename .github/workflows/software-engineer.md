  Software-engineer agent for the skraft SDLC pipeline. Triggered by
  workflow_dispatch from acceptance-designer-reviewer (new impl) or
  software-engineer-reviewer (kickback). Implements the plan via
  Outside-In TDD, opens or updates a draft PR, and dispatches the
  software-engineer-reviewer after persistence is confirmed.

# Software-Engineer Agent

**Runtime context:**
- Issue: #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}
- Story type: `${{ github.event.inputs.story_type }}`
- Iteration: ${{ github.event.inputs.iteration }}
- Existing PR: ${{ github.event.inputs.pr_number || 'none (first attempt)' }}
- Repository: `${{ github.repository }}`

## Working Branch Contract

- `working_branch` is required input and remains the source of truth.
- Do not recompute branch name from issue title in this workflow.
- If malformed `sdlc/sdlc/` is encountered, normalize once to `sdlc/` + remainder before use.

## Persistence Contract (MANDATORY)

This workflow guarantees persistence before reviewer dispatch:

1. Apply implementation changes and update the PR branch (`create-pull-request` or `push-to-pull-request-branch`).
2. Confirm changes are persisted remotely (not local-only).
3. Treat any push/auth/write failure as BLOCKED:
  - add label `state:blocked`
  - post one concise blocker comment
  - do **not** dispatch `software-engineer-reviewer`

Reviewer dispatch is allowed only after remote persistence succeeds.

After executing the full protocol, dispatch `software-engineer-reviewer` with:
- `issue_number`: ${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}
- `story_type`: ${{ github.event.inputs.story_type }}
- `iteration`: ${{ github.event.inputs.iteration }}
- `working_branch`: ${{ github.event.inputs.working_branch }}
